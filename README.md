# JavaScript Libraries

### 1. Dojo
A JavaScript toolkit that saves you time and scales with your development process. Provides everything you need to build a Web app. Language utilities, UI components, and more, all in one place, designed to work together perfectly. - [https://dojotoolkit.org/](https://dojotoolkit.org/)

#### Sample Code

``` 
<script>
        require([
            'dojo/dom',
            'dojo/dom-construct'
        ], function (dom, domConstruct) {
            var greetingNode = dom.byId('greeting');
            domConstruct.place('<em> Dojo!</em>', greetingNode);
        });
    </script> 
```
    
### 2. JQuery
jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript. - [https://jquery.com/](https://jquery.com/)

#### Sample Code

``` 
var hiddenBox = $( "#banner-message" );
$( "#button-container button" ).on( "click", function( event ) {
  hiddenBox.show();
}); 
```

### 3. Datejs
Datejs is an open-source JavaScript Date Library. Comprehensive, yet simple, stealthy and fast. Datejs has passed all trials and is ready to strike. Datejs doesnâ€™t just parse strings, it slices them cleanly in two. - [http://www.datejs.com/](http://www.datejs.com/)

#### Sample Code

```
// Get the first Monday of the year
Date.january().first().monday()
 
// Get the last Friday of the year
Date.dec().final().fri()
 
// Set a date to the 15th of the current month at 4:30 PM,
// then add 90 days and make sure that date is a weekday,
// else move to the next weekday.
var d1 = Date.today()
    .set({ day: 15, hour: 16, minute: 30 })
    .add({ days: 90 })
if (!d1.isWeekday()) {
    d1.next().monday();
} 
```

### Library VS Framework

Libraries are the older concept and these are just collection of utility classes/methods your code calsl upon to get some functionality. Frameworks, on the other hand, contain some functionality or flow and calls your code to extend or make the flow a specific one. The principle of frameworks calling your code is known as "Inversion of Control."
